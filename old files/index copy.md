# Machine Learning Student Project

I use this website to host some learning material for student projects at the University of St Andrews. 

- [Week 1](./MLE.jl.html), maximum likelihood estimation.
  - [Week 1 discussion](./MLE_sol_part1.jl.html)
  - [Week 1 discussion 2](./MLE_sol_part2.jl.html)
- [Week 2](./Bayes1.jl.html), basis expansion, regularization, and Bayesian inference 1
  - [Week 2 discussion](./Bayes1_sol.jl.html)
- [Week 3](./Bayes2.jl.html), Bayesian inference 2, MCMC
  - [Week 3 discussion](./Bayes2_sol.jl.html)
- [Week 4](./Bayes3.jl.html), Bayesian inference 3, variational inference
