# Machine Learning Student Project

I use this website to host some learning material for student projects at the University of St Andrews. 

- [Week 1](./MLE.html), maximum likelihood estimation.
- [Week 2](./Bayes1.html), basis expansion, regularization, and Bayesian inference 1
- [Week 3](./Bayes2.html), Bayesian inference 2, MCMC
- [Week 4](./Bayes3.html), Bayesian inference 3, variational inference
